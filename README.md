# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using techniques like SMOTE to handle imbalanced data and models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, the pipeline predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent based on a dataset of past transactions.
